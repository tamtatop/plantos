	"description": "The Peace Lily has been around for decades for a good reason: It is one of the easiest houseplants to grow because they thrive in low light conditions though they are toxic if ingested, so not highly recommended if you have cats, dogs or children.\nSpathiphyllums have been proven to be among the best houseplants to help improve indoor air quality which makes it perfect for bedrooms, livings rooms, and offices. Plus, it happily blooms throughout the year and can reach up to 90cm height.",

			"title": "How to water Peace Lily?",
			"icon": "drops.svg",
			"text": "It's easy to know when a Peace Lily is thirsty because its leaves will look droop. Water your Spathiphyllum Wallisii frequently because they like to be moist, but once per week is more than enough in case it receives plenty of light.\nSpathiphyllum is sensible to chlorine so you better use filtered water or leave your tap water out for 24+ hours so the chlorine breaks down or its leaves will start to look bad."
