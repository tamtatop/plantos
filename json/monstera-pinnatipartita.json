	"description": "Monstera Pinnatipartita is a rare evergreen and beautiful climbing plant originally from South America that looks similar to Monstera Deliciosa. It has divided leaves when it matures and produces white waxy flowers that along with its aerial roots, make it look wildly.\nMonstera Pinnatipartita must be placed away from the direct sun because it will burn its leaves, and far from pets and children because it's mildly toxic if ingested.\nIt is so recommended to use totems or to place it in a spot where it can trail to maximize its growth. As a houseplant it doesn't grow much but outside, it can take a whole big corner.",
